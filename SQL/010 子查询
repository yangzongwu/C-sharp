用join就可以
select distinct P1.FirstName
from Person.Person as P1
where (
select count(*)
from Person.person as P2
where P1.FirstName=P2.FirstName
)>90

和上面列子一样
select *
from Person.Person
group by FirstName
having count(FirstName)>90
order by FirstName


select distinct(p1.FirstName)
from Person.Person as p1
where p1.FirstName in (
select LastName
from Person.Person as p2)

select distinct(p1.FirstName)
from Person.Person as p1
join Person.Person as p2
on p1.FirstName =p2.LastName


------------------------子查询----------------------------------------
select distinct(p1.FirstName)
from Person.Person as p1
where p1.FirstName in (
select LastName
from Person.Person as p2)


select distinct(p1.FirstName)
from Person.Person as p1
where 
exists(
select LastName
from person.Person as p2 
where p1.FirstName=p2.LastName)


select distinct(p1.FirstName)
from Person.Person as p1
join Person.Person as p2
on p1.FirstName =p2.LastName
