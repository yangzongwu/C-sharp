In this module, we are going to learn the most important five object-oriented design principles:
* SRP: Single responsibility principle
* OCP: Open/closed principle
* LSP: Liskov substitution principle
* ISP: Interface segregation principle
* DIP: Dependency inversion principle

SRP
The Single Responsibility Principle
单一责任原则
当需要修改某个类的时候原因有且只有一个（THERE SHOULD NEVER BE MORE THAN ONE REASON FOR A CLASS TO CHANGE）。
换句话说就是让一个类只做一种类型责任，当这个类需要承当其他类型的责任的时候，就需要分解这个类。


OCP
The Open Closed Principle
开放封闭原则
software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification

LSP
The Liskov Substitution Principle
里氏替换原则


DIP
The Dependency Inversion Principle
依赖倒置原则


ISP
The Interface Segregation Principle
接口分离原则
The interface-segregation principle (ISP) states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
